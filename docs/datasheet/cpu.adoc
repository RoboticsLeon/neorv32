[NOTE]
It is recommended to use the **NEORV32 Processor** as default top instance even if you only want to use the actual
CPU. Simply disable all the processor-internal modules via the generics and you will get a "CPU
wrapper" that provides a minimal CPU environment and an external bus interface (like AXI4). This
setup also allows to further use the default bootloader and software framework. From this base you
can start building your own SoC. Of course you can also use the CPU in itâ€™s true stand-alone mode.

[NOTE]
This documentation assumes the reader is familiar with the official RISC-V "User" and "Privileged Architecture" specifications.

:sectnums:
=== Architecture

The NEORV32 CPU was designed from scratch based only on the official ISA / privileged architecture
specifications. The following figure shows the simplified architecture of the CPU.

image::neorv32_cpu.png[align=center]

The CPU implements a _multi-cycle_ architecture. Hence, each instruction is executed as a series of consecutive
micro-operations. In order to increase performance, the CPU's **front-end** (instruction fetch) and **back-end**
(instruction execution) are de-couples via a FIFO (the "instruction prefetch buffer"). Therefore, the
front-end can already fetch new instructions while the back-end is still processing previously-fetched instructions.

The front-end is responsible for fetching 32-bit chunks of instruction words (one aligned 32-bit instruction,
two 16-bit instructions or a mixture if 32-bit instructions are not aligned to 32-bit boundaries). The instruction
data is stored to a FIFO queue - the instruction prefetch buffer.

The back-end is responsible for the actual execution of the instruction. It includes an "issue engine",
which takes data from the instruction prefetch buffer and assembles 32-bit instruction words (plain 32-bit
instruction or decompressed 16-bit instructions) for execution.

Front-end and back-end operate in parallel and with overlapping operations. Hence, the optimal CPI
(cycles per instructions) is 2, but it can be significantly higher: for instance when executing loads/stores
(accessing memory-mapped devices with high latency), executing multi-cycle ALU operations (like divisions) or
when the CPU front-end has to reload the prefetch buffer due to a taken branch.

Basically, the NEORV32 CPU is somewhere between a classical pipelined architecture, where each stage
requires exactly one processing cycle (if not stalled) and a classical multi-cycle architecture, which executes
every single instruction (_including_ fetch) in a series of consecutive micro-operations. The combination of
these two classical design paradigms allows an increased instruction execution in contrast to a pure multi-cycle
approach (due to overlapping operation of fetch and execute) at a reduced hardware footprint (due to the
multi-cycle concept).

As a Von-Neumann machine, the CPU provides independent interfaces for instruction fetch and data access.
These two bus interfaces are merged into a single processor-internal bus via a prioritizing bus switch (data accesses
have higher priority). Hence, ALL memory locations including peripheral devices are mapped to a single unified 32-bit
address space.


// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Full Virtualization

Just like the RISC-V ISA the NEORV32 aims to provide _maximum virtualization_ capabilities on CPU _and_ SoC level to
allow a high standard of **execution safety**. The CPU supports **all** traps specified by the official RISC-V specifications.
footnote:[If the `Zicsr` CPU extension is enabled (implementing the full set of the privileged architecture).]
Thus, the CPU provides defined hardware fall-backs via traps for any expected and unexpected situation (e.g. executing an
malformed instruction word or accessing a not-allocated memory address). For any kind of trap the core is always in a
defined and fully synchronized state throughout the whole architecture (i.e. there are no out-of-order operations that
might have to reverted). This allows predictable execution behavior at any time improving overall _execution safety_.

**Execution Safety - NEORV32 Virtualization Features**

* Due to the acknowledged memory accesses the CPU is _always_ sync with the memory system
(i.e. there is no speculative execution / no out-of-order states).
* The CPU supports _all_ RISC-V compatible bus exceptions including access exceptions, which are triggered if an
accessed address does not respond or encounters an internal error during access.
* Accessed memory addresses (plain memory, but also memory-mapped devices) need to respond within a fixed time
window. Otherwise a bus access exception is raised.
* The RISC-V specs. state that executing an malformed instruction results in unpredictable behavior. As an additional
execution safety feature the NEORV32 CPU ensures that _all_ unimplemented/malformed/illegal instructions do raise an
illegal instruction exceptions and do not commit any state-changing operation (like writing registers or triggering
memory operations).
* To be continued...

==== RISC-V Incompatibility Issues and Limitations

This list shows the currently identified issues regarding full RISC-V-compatibility. More specific information
can be found in section <<_instruction_sets_and_extensions>>.

.Hardwired R/W CSRs
[IMPORTANT]
The `misa`, `mip` and `mtval` CSRs in the NEORV32 are _read-only_.
Any write access to it (in machine mode) to them are ignored and will _not_ cause any exceptions or side-effects.
Pending interrupt can only be cleared by acknowledging the interrupt-causing device. However, pending interrupts
can still be ignored by clearing the according `mie` register bits.

.Physical memory protection
[IMPORTANT]
The physical memory protection (see section <<_machine_physical_memory_protection>>)
only supports the modes _OFF_ and _NAPOT_ yet and a minimal granularity of 8 bytes per region.

.Atomic memory operations
[IMPORTANT]
The `A` CPU extension only implements the `lr.w` and `sc.w` instructions yet.
However, these instructions are sufficient to emulate all further atomic memory operations.

.Bit-manipulation operations
[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32 `B` extension only implements the _basic bit-manipulation instructions_ (`Zbb`) subset
and the _address generation instructions_ (`Zba`) subset yet.

.Instruction Misalignment
[NOTE]
This is not a real RISC-V incompatibility, but something that might not be clear when studying the RISC-V privileged
architecture specifications: for 32-bit only instructions (no `C` extension) the misaligned instruction exception
is raised if bit 1 of the access address is set (i.e. not on 32-bit boundary). If the `C` extension is implemented
there will be no misaligned instruction exceptions _at all_.
In both cases bit 0 of the program counter and all related registers is hardwired to zero.

=== CPU Top Entity - Generics

Most of the CPU configuration generics are a subset of the actual Processor configuration generics (see section <<_processor_top_entity_generics>>).
and are not listed here. However, the CPU provides some _specific_ generics that are used to configure the CPU for the
NEORV32 processor setup. These generics are assigned by the processor setup only and are not available for user defined configuration.
The _specific_ generics are listed below.

[cols="4,4,2"]
[frame="all",grid="none"]
|======
| **CPU_BOOT_ADDR** | _std_ulogic_vector(31 downto 0)_ | 0x00000000
3+| This address defines the reset address at which the CPU starts fetching instructions after reset. In terms of the NEORV32 processor, this
generic is configured with the base address of the bootloader ROM (default) or with the base address of the processor-internal instruction
memory (IMEM) if the bootloader is disabled (_INT_BOOTLOADER_EN_ = _false_). See section <<_address_space>> for more information.

// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Instruction Sets and Extensions

The basic NEORV32 is a RISC-V `rv32i` architecture that provides several _optional_ RISC-V CPU and ISA
(instruction set architecture) extensions. For more information regarding the RISC-V ISA extensions please
see the the _RISC-V Instruction Set Manual - Volume I: Unprivileged ISA_ and _The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual
Volume II: Privileged Architecture_, which are available in the projects `docs/references` folder.

[TIP]
The CPU can discover available ISA extensions via the <<_misa>> CSR and the
`CPU` <<_system_configuration_information_memory_sysinfo, SYSINFO>> register
or by executing an instruction and checking for an _illegal instruction exception_.

[NOTE]
Executing an instruction from an extension that is not supported yet or that is currently not enabled
(via the according top entity generic) will raise an _illegal instruction_ exception.


==== **`A`** - Atomic Memory Access

Atomic memory access instructions allow more sophisticated memory operations like implementing semaphores and mutexes.
The RICS-C specs. defines a specific _atomic_ extension that provides instructions for atomic memory accesses. The `A`
ISA extension is enabled if the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_A` configuration generic is _true_.
In this case the following additional instructions are available:

* `lr.w`: load-reservate
* `sc.w`: store-conditional

[NOTE]
Even though only `lr.w` and `sc.w` instructions are implemented yet, all further atomic operations
(load-modify-write instruction) can be emulated using these two instruction. Furthermore, the
instruction's ordering flags (`aq` and `lr`) are ignored by the CPU hardware. Using any other (not yet
implemented) AMO (atomic memory operation) will raise an illegal instruction exception.

The *load-reservate* instruction behaves as a "normal" load-word instruction (`lw`) but will also set a CPU-internal
_data memory access lock_. Executing a *store-conditional* behaves as "normal" store-word instruction (`sw`) that will
only conduct an actual memory write operations if the lock is still intact. Additionally, the store-conditional instruction
will also return the lock state (returns zero if the lock is still intact or non-zero if the lock has been broken).
After the execution of the `sc` instruction, the lock is automatically removed.

The lock is broken if at least one of the following conditions occur:
. executing any data memory access instruction other than `lr.w`
. raising _any_ t (for example an interrupt or a memory access exception)

[NOTE]
The atomic instructions have special requirements for memory system / bus interconnect. More
information can be found in sections <<_bus_interface>> and <<_processor_external_memory_interface_wishbone_axi4_lite>>, respectively.


==== **`B`** - Bit-Manipulation Operations

The `B` ISA extension adds instructions for bit-manipulation operations. This extension is enabled if the
`CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_B` configuration generic is _true_.
The official RISC-V specifications can be found here: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bitmanip

[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32 `B` extension only implements the _basic bit-manipulation instructions_ (`Zbb`) subset
and the _address generation instructions_ (`Zba`) subset yet.

The `Zbb` sub-extension adds the following instruction:

* `andn`, `orn`, `xnor`
* `clz`, `ctz`, `cpop`
* `max`, `maxu`, `min`, `minu`
* `sext.b`, `sext.h`, `zext.h`
* `rol`, `ror`, `rori`
* `orc.b`, `rev8`

The `Zba` sub-extension adds the following instruction:

* `sh1add`, `sh2add`, `sh3add`

[TIP]
By default, the bit-manipulation unit uses an _iterative_ approach to compute shift-related operations
like `clz` and `rol`. To increase performance (at the cost of additional hardware resources) the 
<<_fast_shift_en>> generic can be enabled to implement full-parallel logic (like barrel shifters) for all
shift-related `B` instructions.

[WARNING]
The `B` extension is frozen but not officially ratified yet. There is no
software support for this extension in the upstream GCC RISC-V port yet. However, an
intrinsic library is provided to utilize the provided `B` extension features from C-language
code (see `sw/example/bitmanip_test`).


==== **`C`** - Compressed Instructions

The _compressed_ ISA extension provides 16-bit encodings of commonly used instructions to reduce code space size.
The `C` extension is available when the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_C` configuration generic is _true_.
In this case the following instructions are available:

* `c.addi4spn`, `c.lw`, `c.sw`, `c.nop`, `c.addi`, `c.jal`, `c.li`, `c.addi16sp`, `c.lui`, `c.srli`, `c.srai` `c.andi`, `c.sub`,
`c.xor`, `c.or`, `c.and`, `c.j`, `c.beqz`, `c.bnez`, `c.slli`, `c.lwsp`, `c.jr`, `c.mv`, `c.ebreak`, `c.jalr`, `c.add`, `c.swsp`

[NOTE]
When the compressed instructions extension is enabled, branches to an _unaligned_ and _uncompressed_ instruction require
an additional instruction fetch to load the according second half-word of that instruction. The performance can be increased
again by forcing a 32-bit alignment of branch target addresses. By default, this is enforced via the GCC `-falign-functions=4`,
`-falign-labels=4`, `-falign-loops=4` and `-falign-jumps=4` compile flags (via the makefile).


==== **`E`** - Embedded CPU

The embedded CPU extensions reduces the size of the general purpose register file from 32 entries to 16 entries to
decrease physical hardware requirements (for example block RAM). This extensions is enabled when the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_E`
configuration generic is _true_. Accesses to registers beyond `x15` will raise and _illegal instruction exception_.
This extension does not add any additional instructions or features.

[IMPORTANT]
Due to the reduced register file size an alternate toolchain ABI (**`ilp32e`**) is required.


==== **`I`** - Base Integer ISA

The CPU always supports the complete `rv32i` base integer instruction set. This base set is always enabled
regardless of the setting of the remaining exceptions. The base instruction set includes the following
instructions:

* immediate: `lui`, `auipc`
* jumps: `jal`, `jalr`
* branches: `beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`, `bltu`, `bgeu`
* memory: `lb`, `lh`, `lw`, `lbu`, `lhu`, `sb`, `sh`, `sw`
* alu: `addi`, `slti`, `sltiu`, `xori`, `ori`, `andi`, `slli`, `srli`, `srai`, `add`, `sub`, `sll`, `slt`, `sltu`, `xor`, `srl`, `sra`, `or`, `and`
* environment: `ecall`, `ebreak`, `fence`

[NOTE]
In order to keep the hardware footprint low, the CPU's shift unit uses a bit-serial serial approach. Hence, shift operations
take up to 32 cycles (plus overhead) depending on the actual shift amount. Alternatively, the shift operations can be processed
completely in parallels by a fast (but large) barrel shifter when the `FAST_SHIFT_EN` generic is _true_. In that case, shift operations
complete within 2 cycles (plus overhead) regardless of the actual shift amount.

[NOTE]
Internally, the `fence` instruction does not perform any operation inside the CPU. It only sets the
topâ€™s `d_bus_fence_o` signal high for one cycle to inform the memory system a `fence` instruction has been
executed. Any flags within the `fence` instruction word are ignore by the hardware.


==== **`M`** - Integer Multiplication and Division

Hardware-accelerated integer multiplication and division operations are available when the
`CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_M` configuration generic is _true_. In this case the following instructions are
available:

* multiplication: `mul`, `mulh`, `mulhsu`, `mulhu`
* division: `div`, `divu`, `rem`, `remu`

[NOTE]
By default, multiplication and division operations are executed in a bit-serial approach.
Alternatively, the multiplier core can be implemented using DSP blocks if the `FAST_MUL_EN`
generic is _true_ allowing faster execution. Multiplications and divisions
always require a fixed amount of cycles to complete - regardless of the input operands.


==== **`Zmmul`** - Integer Multiplication

This is a _sub-extension_ of the `M` ISA extension. It implements the multiplication-only operations
of the `M` extensions and is intended for size-constrained setups that require hardware-based
integer multiplications but not hardware-based divisions, which will be computed entirely in software.
This extension requires only ~50% of the hardware utilization of the "full" `M` extension.

* multiplication: `mul`, `mulh`, `mulhsu`, `mulhu`

If `Zmmul` is enabled, executing any division instruction from the `M` ISA extension (`div`, `divu`, `rem`, `remu`)
will raise an _illegal instruction exception_.

Note that `M` and `Zmmul` extensions _cannot_ be enabled at the same time.

[TIP]
If your RISC-V GCC toolchain does not (yet) support the `_Zmmul` ISA extensions, it can be "emulated"
using a `rv32im` machine architecture and setting the `-mno-div` compiler flag
(example `$ make MARCH=rv32im USER_FLAGS+=-mno-div clean_all exe`).


==== **`U`** - Less-Privileged User Mode

In addition to the basic (and highest-privileged) machine-mode, the _user-mode_ ISA extensions adds a second less-privileged
operation mode. It is implemented if the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_U` configuration generic is _true_.
Code executed in user-mode cannot access machine-mode CSRs. Furthermore, user-mode access to the address space (like
peripheral/IO devices) can be constrained via the physical memory protection (_PMP_).
Any kind of privilege rights violation will raise an exception to allow full virtualization.


==== **`X`** - NEORV32-Specific (Custom) Extensions

The NEORV32-specific extensions are always enabled and are indicated by the set `X` bit in the `misa` CSR.

The most important points of the NEORV32-specific extensions are:
* The CPU provides 16 _fast interrupt_ interrupts (`FIRQ)`, which are controlled via custom bits in the `mie`
and `mip` CSR. This extension is mapped to _reserved_ CSR bits, that are available for custom use (according to the
RISC-V specs). Also, custom trap codes for `mcause` are implemented.
* All undefined/unimplemented/malformed/illegal instructions do raise an illegal instruction exception (see <<_full_virtualization>>).


==== **`Zfinx`** Single-Precision Floating-Point Operations

The `Zfinx` floating-point extension is an _alternative_ of the standard `F` floating-point ISA extension.
The `Zfinx` extensions also uses the integer register file `x` to store and operate on floating-point data
instead of a dedicated floating-point register file (hence, `F-in-x`). Thus, the `Zfinx` extension requires
less hardware resources and features faster context changes. This also implies that there are NO dedicated `f`
register file-related load/store or move instructions.
The official RISC-V specifications can be found here: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zfinx

[TIP]
The NEORV32 floating-point unit used by the `Zfinx` extension is compatible to the _IEEE-754_ specifications.

The `Zfinx` extensions only supports single-precision (`.s` instruction suffix), so it is a direct alternative
to the `F` extension. The `Zfinx` extension is implemented when the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_Zfinx` configuration
generic is _true_. In this case the following instructions and CSRs are available:

* conversion: `fcvt.s.w`, `fcvt.s.wu`, `fcvt.w.s`, `fcvt.wu.s`
* comparison: `fmin.s`, `fmax.s`, `feq.s`, `flt.s`, `fle.s`
* computational: `fadd.s`, `fsub.s`, `fmul.s`
* sign-injection: `fsgnj.s`, `fsgnjn.s`, `fsgnjx.s`
* number classification: `fclass.s`

* additional CSRs: `fcsr`, `frm`, `fflags`

[WARNING]
Fused multiply-add instructions `f[n]m[add/sub].s` are not supported!
Division `fdiv.s` and square root `fsqrt.s` instructions are not supported yet!

[WARNING]
Subnormal numbers ("de-normalized" numbers) are not supported by the NEORV32 FPU.
Subnormal numbers (exponent = 0) are _flushed to zero_ setting them to +/- 0 before entering the
FPU's processing core. If a computational instruction (like `fmul.s`) generates a subnormal result, the
result is also flushed to zero during normalization.

[WARNING]
The `Zfinx` extension is not yet officially ratified, but is expected to stay unchanged. There is no
software support for the `Zfinx` extension in the upstream GCC RISC-V port yet. However, an
intrinsic library is provided to utilize the provided `Zfinx` floating-point extension from C-language
code (see `sw/example/floating_point_test`).


==== **`Zicsr`** Control and Status Register Access / Privileged Architecture

The CSR access instructions as well as the exception and interrupt system (= the privileged architecture)
is implemented when the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_Zicsr` configuration generic is _true_.
In this case the following instructions are available:

* CSR access: `csrrw`, `csrrs`, `csrrc`, `csrrwi`, `csrrsi`, `csrrci`
* environment: `mret`, `wfi`

[WARNING]
If the `Zicsr` extension is disabled the CPU does not provide any _privileged architecture_ features at all!
In order to provide the full set of functions and to allow a secure execution
environment the `Zicsr` extension should always be enabled.

[NOTE]
The "wait for interrupt instruction" `wfi` works like a sleep command. When executed, the CPU is
halted until a valid interrupt request occurs. To wake up again, the according interrupt source has to
be enabled via the `mie` CSR and the global interrupt enable flag in `mstatus` has to be set.

[NOTE]
The `wfi` instruction may also be executed in user-mode without causing an exception as <<_mstatus>> bit
`TW` (timeout wait) is hardwired to zero.




==== **`Zicntr`** CPU Base Counters

The `Zicntr` ISA extension adds the basic cycle `[m]cycle[h]`), instruction-retired (`[m]instret[h]`) and time (`time[h]`)
counters. This extensions is stated is _mandatory_ by the RISC-V spec. However, size-constrained setups may remove support for
these counters. Section <<_machine_counter_and_timer_csrs>> shows a list of all `Zicntr`-related CSRs.
These are available if the `Zicntr` ISA extensions is enabled via the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zicntr>> generic.

[NOTE]
Disabling the `Zicntr` extension does not remove the `time[h]`-driving MTIME unit.

If `Zicntr` is disabled, all accesses to the according counter CSRs will raise an illegal instruction exception.



==== **`Zihpm`** Hardware Performance Monitors

In additions to the base cycle, instructions-retired and time counters the NEORV32 CPU provides
up to 29 hardware performance monitors (HPM 3..31), which can be used to benchmark applications. Each HPM consists of an
N-bit wide counter (split in a high-word 32-bit CSR and a low-word 32-bit CSR), where N is defined via the top's
`HPM_CNT_WIDTH` generic (0..64-bit) and a corresponding event configuration CSR. The event configuration
CSR defines the architectural events that lead to an increment of the associated HPM counter.

The HPM counters are available if the `Zihpm` ISA extensions is enabled via the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zihpm>> generic.

Depending on the configuration the following additional CSR are available:

* counters: `mhpmcounter*[h]` (3..31, depending on `HPM_NUM_CNTS`)
* event configuration: `mhpmevent*` (3..31, depending on `HPM_NUM_CNTS`)

[IMPORTANT]
The HPM counter CSR can only be accessed in machine-mode. Hence, the according `mcounteren` CSR bits
are always zero and read-only. Any access from less-privileged modes will raise an illegal instruction
exception.

[TIP]
Auto-increment of the HPMs can be individually deactivated via the `mcountinhibit` CSR.

[TIP]
For a list of all HPM-related CSRs and all provided event configurations
see section <<_hardware_performance_monitors_hpm>>.


==== **`Zifencei`** Instruction Stream Synchronization

The `Zifencei` CPU extension is implemented if the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_Zifencei` configuration
generic is _true_. It allows manual synchronization of the instruction stream via the following instruction:

* `fence.i`

The `fence.i` instruction resets the CPU's front-end (instruction fetch) and flushes the prefetch buffer.
This allows a clean re-fetch of modified instructions from memory. Also, the top's `i_bus_fencei_o` signal is set
high for one cycle to inform the memory system (like the i-cache to perform a flush/reload.
Any additional flags within the `fence.i` instruction word are ignore by the hardware.


==== **`PMP`** Physical Memory Protection

The NEORV32 physical memory protection (PMP) is compatible to the RISC-V PMP specifications. It can be used
to constrain memory read/write/execute rights for each available privilege level.

The NEORV32 PMP only supports _NAPOT_ mode yet and a minimal region size (granularity) of 8 bytes. Larger
minimal sizes can be configured via the top `PMP_MIN_GRANULARITY` generic to reduce hardware requirements.
The physical memory protection system is implemented when the `PMP_NUM_REGIONS` configuration generic is >0.
In this case the following additional CSRs are available:

* `pmpcfg*` (0..15, depending on configuration): PMP configuration registers
* `pmpaddr*` (0..63, depending on configuration): PMP address registers

[TIP]
See section <<_machine_physical_memory_protection>> for more information regarding the PMP CSRs.

The actual number of regions and the minimal region granularity are defined via the top entity
`PMP_MIN_GRANULARITY` and `PMP_NUM_REGIONS` generics. `PMP_MIN_GRANULARITY` defines the minimal available
granularity of each region in bytes. `PMP_NUM_REGIONS` defines the total number of implemented regions and thus, the
number of available `pmpcfg*` and `pmpaddr*` CSRs.

When implementing more PMP regions that a _certain critical limit_ *an additional register stage
is automatically inserted* into the CPU's memory interfaces to reduce critical path length. Unfortunately, this will also
increase the latency of instruction fetches and data access by +1 cycle.

The critical limit can be adapted for custom use by a constant from the main VHDL package file
(`rtl/core/neorv32_package.vhd`). The default value is 8:

[source,vhdl]
----
-- "critical" number of PMP regions --
constant pmp_num_regions_critical_c : natural := 8;
----

**Operation**

Any CPU memory access address (from the instruction fetch or data access interface) is tested if it is accessing _any_
of the specified  PMP regions(configured via `pmpaddr*` and enabled via `pmpcfg*`). If an
address matches one of these regions, the configured access rights (attributes in `pmpcfg*`) are enforced:

* a write access (store) will fail if no write attribute is set
* a read access (load) will fail if no read attribute is set
* an instruction fetch access will fail if no execute attribute is set

If an access to a protected region does not have the according access rights it will raise the according
instruction/load/store _access fault_ exception.

By default, all PMP checks are enforced for user-level programs only. If you wish to enforce the physical
memory protection also for machine-level programs you need to set the _locked bit_ in the according
`pmpcfg*` configuration CSR.

[IMPORTANT]
After updating the address configuration registers `pmpaddr*` the system requires up to 33 cycles for
internal (iterative) computations before the configuration becomes valid.

[NOTE]
For more information regarding RISC-V physical memory protection see the official _The RISC-V
Instruction Set Manual - Volume II: Privileged Architecture_ specifications.

:sectnums:
==== Traps, Exceptions and Interrupts

In this document the following nomenclature regarding traps is used:

* _interrupts_ = asynchronous exceptions
* _exceptions_ = synchronous exceptions
* _traps_ = exceptions + interrupts (synchronous or asynchronous exceptions)

Whenever an exception or interrupt is triggered, the CPU transfers control to the address stored in `mtvec`
CSR. The cause of the according interrupt or exception can be determined via the content of `mcause`
CSR. The address that reflects the current program counter when a trap was taken is stored to `mepc` CSR.
Additional information regarding the cause of the trap can be retrieved from `mtval` CSR.

The traps are prioritized. If several _exceptions_ occur at once only the one with highest priority is triggered
while all remaining exceptions are ignored. If several _interrupts_ trigger at once, the one with highest priority
is serviced first while the remaining ones stay _pending_. After completing the interrupt handler the interrupt with
the second highest priority will get serviced and so on until no further interrupt are pending.

.Interrupt Signal Requirements
[IMPORTANT]
All interrupts request signals (including FIRQs) are **high-active**. A request has to stay at high-level (=asserted)
until it is explicitly acknowledged by the CPU software (for example by writing to a specific memory-mapped register).

.Instruction Atomicity
[NOTE]
All instructions execute as atomic operations - interrupts can only trigger between two instructions.
So if there is a permanent interrupt request, exactly one instruction from the interrupt program will be executed before
a new interrupt handler can start.


:sectnums:
==== Memory Access Exceptions**

If a load operation causes any exception, the instruction's destination register is
_not written_ at all. Load exceptions caused by a misalignment or a physical memory protection fault do not
trigger a bus read-operation at all. Exceptions caused by a store address misalignment or a store physical
memory protection fault do not trigger a bus write-operation at all.


:sectnums:
==== Custom Fast Interrupt Request Lines

As a custom extension, the NEORV32 CPU features 16 fast interrupt request (FIRQ) lines via the `firq_i` CPU top
entity signals. These interrupts have custom configuration and status flags in the `mie` and `mip` CSRs and also
provide custom trap codes in `mcause`. These FIRQs are reserved for NEORV32 processor-internal usage only.

==== Bus Interface

The CPU provides two independent bus interfaces: One for fetching instructions (`i_bus_*`) and one for
accessing data (`d_bus_*`) via load and store operations. Both interfaces use the same interface protocol.

:sectnums:
===== Address Space

The CPU is a 32-bit architecture with separated instruction and data interfaces making it a Harvard
Architecture. Each of this interfaces can access an address space of up to 2^32^ bytes (4GB). The memory
system is based on 32-bit words with a minimal granularity of 1 byte. Please note, that the NEORV32 CPU
does not support unaligned memory accesses _in hardware_ - however, a software-based handling can be
implemented as any unaligned memory access will trigger an according exception.

|=======================

[NOTE]
Currently, there a no pipelined or overlapping operations implemented within the same bus interface.
So only a single transfer request can be "on the fly".

===== Protocol

A bus request is triggered either by the `bus_re_o` signal (for reading data) or by the `bus_we_o` signal (for
writing data). These signals are active for exactly one cycle and initiate either a read or a write transaction. The transaction is
completed when the accessed peripheral either sets the `bus_ack_i` signal (-> successful completion) or the
`bus_err_i` signal is set (-> failed completion). All these control signals are only active (= high) for one
single cycle. An error indicated via the `bus_err_i` signal during a transfer will trigger the according instruction bus
access fault or load/store bus access fault exception.

[NOTE]
The transfer can be completed directly in the same cycle as it was initiated (via the `bus_re_o` or `bus_we_o`
signal) if the peripheral sets `bus_ack_i` or `bus_err_i` high for one cycle. However, in order to shorten the critical path such "asynchronous"
completion should be avoided. The default processor-internal module provide exactly **one cycle delay** between initiation and completion of transfers.

.Bus Keeper: Processor-internal memories and memory-mapped devices with variable / high latency
[IMPORTANT]
Processor-internal peripherals or memories do not have to respond within one cycle after the transfer initiation (= latency > 1 cycle).
However, the bus transaction has to be completed (= acknowledged) within a certain **response time window**. This time window is defined
by the global `max_proc_int_response_time_c` constant (default = 15 cycles) from the processor's VHDL package file (`rtl/neorv32_package.vhd`).
It defines the maximum number of cycles after which an _unacknowledged_ processor-internal bus transfer will timeout and raise a **bus fault exception**.
The _BUSKEEPER_ hardware module (see section <<_internal_bus_monitor_buskeeper>>) keeps track of all _internal_ bus transactions. If any bus operations times out
(for example when accessing "address space holes") this unit will issue a bus error to the CPU that will raise the according instruction fetch or data access bus exception.
Note that **the bus keeper does not track external accesses via the external memory bus interface**. However, the external memory bus interface also provides
an _optional_ bus timeout (see section <<_processor_external_memory_interface_wishbone_axi4_lite>>).

**Exemplary Bus Accesses**

| Read access | Write access
|=======================

**Write Access**

For a write access, the accessed address (`bus_addr_o`), the data to be written (`bus_wdata_o`) and the byte
enable signals (`bus_ben_o`) are set when bus_we_o goes high. These three signals are kept stable until the
transaction is completed. In the example the accessed peripheral cannot answer directly in the next
cycle after issuing. Here, the transaction is successful and the peripheral sets the `bus_ack_i` signal several
cycles after issuing.

**Read Access**

For a read access, the accessed address (`bus_addr_o`) is set when `bus_re_o` goes high. The address is kept
stable until the transaction is completed. In the example the accessed peripheral cannot answer
directly in the next cycle after issuing. The peripheral hast to apply the read data right in the same cycle as
the bus transaction is completed (here, the transaction is successful and the peripheral sets the `bus_ack_i`
signal).

**Access Boundaries**

The instruction interface will always access memory on word (= 32-bit) boundaries even if fetching
compressed (16-bit) instructions. The data interface can access memory on byte (= 8-bit), half-word (= 16-
bit) and word (= 32-bit) boundaries.

**Exclusive (Atomic) Access**

The CPU can access memory in an exclusive manner by generating a load-reservate and store-conditional
combination. Normally, these combinations should target the same memory address.

The CPU starts an exclusive access to memory via the _load-reservate instruction_ (`lr.w`). This instruction
will set the CPU-internal _exclusive access lock_, which directly drives the `d_bus_lock_o`. It is the task of
the memory system to manage this exclusive access reservation by storing the according access address and
the source of the access itself (for example via the CPU ID in a multi-core system).

When the CPU executes a _store-conditional instruction_ (`sc.w`) the _CPU-internal exclusive access lock_ is
evaluated to check if the exclusive access was successful. If the lock is still OK, the instruction will write-back
zero and will allow the according store operation to the memory system. If the lock is broken, the
instruction will write-back non-zero and will not generate an actual memory store operation.

The CPU-internal exclusive access lock is broken if at least one of the situations appear.

* when executing any other memory-access operation than `lr.w`
* when any trap (sync. or async.) is triggered (for example to force a context switch)
* when the memory system signals a bus error (via the `bus_err_i` signal)

[TIP]
For more information regarding the SoC-level behavior and requirements of atomic operations see
section <<_processor_external_memory_interface_wishbone_axi4_lite>>.

**Memory Barriers**

Whenever the CPU executes a fence instruction, the according interface signal is set high for one cycle
(`d_bus_fence_o` for a _fence_ instruction; `i_bus_fence_o` for a _fencei_ instruction). It is the task of the
memory system to perform the necessary operations (like a cache flush and refill).

==== CPU Hardware Reset

In order to reduce routing constraints (and by this the actual hardware requirements), most uncritical
registers of the NEORV32 CPU as well as most register of the whole NEORV32 Processor do not use **a
dedicated hardware reset**. "Uncritical registers" in this context means that the initial value of these registers
after power-up is not relevant for a defined CPU boot process.

**Rational**

A good example to illustrate the concept of uncritical registers is a pipelined processing engine. Each stage
of the engine features an N-bit _data register_ and a 1-bit _status register_. The status register is set when the
data in the according data register is valid. At the end of the pipeline the status register might trigger a write-back
of the processing result to some kind of memory. The initial status of the data registers after power-up is
irrelevant as long as the status registers are all reset to a defined value that indicates there is no valid data in
the pipelineâ€™s data register. Therefore, the pipeline data register do no require a dedicated reset as they do not
control the actual operation (in contrast to the status register). This makes the pipeline data registers from
this example "uncritical registers".

**NEORV32 CPU Reset**

In terms of the NEORV32 CPU, there are several pipeline registers, state machine registers and even status
and control registers (CSRs) that do not require a defined initial state to ensure a correct boot process. The
pipeline register will get initialized by the CPUâ€™s internal state machines, which are initialized from the main
control engine that actually features a defined reset. The initialization of most of the CPU's core CSRs (like
interrupt control) is done by the software (to be more specific, this is done by the `crt0.S` start-up code).

During the very early boot process (where `crt0.S` is running) there is no chance for undefined behavior due to
the lack of dedicated hardware resets of certain CSRs. For example the machine interrupt-enable CSR (`mie`)
does not provide a dedicated reset. The value after reset of this register is uncritical as interrupts cannot fire
because the global interrupt enabled flag in the status register (`mstatsus(mie)`) provides a dedicated
hardware reset setting it to low (globally disabling interrupts).

**Reset Configuration**

Most CPU-internal register do feature an asynchronous reset in the VHDL code, but the "don't care" value
(VHDL `'-'`) is used for initialization of the uncritical register, effectively generating a flip-flop without a
reset. However, certain applications or situations (like advanced gate-level / timing simulations) might
require a more deterministic reset state. For this case, a defined reset level (reset-to-low) of all registers can
be enabled via a constant in the main VHDL package file (`rtl/core/neorv32_package.vhd`):

-- "critical" number of PMP regions --
constant dedicated_reset_c : boolean := false; -- use dedicated hardware reset value
for UNCRITICAL registers (FALSE=reset value is irrelevant (might simplify HW),
